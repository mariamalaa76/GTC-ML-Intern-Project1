# Hotel Booking Cancellation ‚Äì Data Preprocessing Pipeline
This project was developed as part of my internship to build a **robust data preprocessing pipeline** for a hotel booking cancellation prediction model.
The goal of the project is **not** to build the final prediction model, but to prepare the raw dataset for machine learning by cleaning, transforming, and engineering features. The quality of this preprocessing will directly influence the success of future models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
* **missingno** (for missing data visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (for train-test split, encoding utilities)

## üìä Key Outcomes
* Identified and fixed missing values & duplicates.
* Handled outliers to prevent skewed model performance.
* Engineered meaningful features to enrich the dataset.
* Produced a **clean, structured dataset** ready for machine learning.
